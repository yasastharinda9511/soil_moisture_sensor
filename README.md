# soil_moisture_sensor

# Introduction

The aim of this project is to implement a sensor that is capable of measuring soil moisture and the conductivity in very efficient manner. 
The existing high-end soil moisture sensors thar are having capabilities mention above much more expensive and not affordable for 
the farmers in villages. Therefore, our main idea is to implement a low-cost sensor but having these features.
It was something hard but after going through the previous design, it became normal. 
Then I identified what are the weaknesses of 1st design cycle of the soil moisture sensor and started to design own one referring previous design.

# Design 

  Altium Designer is used to finalizeall the PCB works and creating BOMs.
